/*
Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibium Point in the array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5 
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2} 
Output: 3 
Explanation: For second test case 
equilibrium point is at position 3 
as elements before it (1+3) = 
elements after it (2+2). 
 

Example 2:

Input:
n = 1
A[] = {1}
Output: 1
Explanation:
Since its the only element hence
its the only equilibrium point.
 

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function equilibriumPoint() which takes the array and n as input parameters and returns the point of equilibrium. Return -1 if no such point exists.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution {

    
    // a: input array
    // n: size of array
    // Function to find equilibrium point in the array.
    public static int equilibriumPoint(long arr[], int n) {

        // Your code here
        long sum = 0;
        for(long ele : arr)
            sum += ele;
        
        long left = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            long right = sum - left - arr[i];
            if(left == right)
                return i+1;
            left += arr[i];
        }
        return -1;
